What if no alarms

Recent Android versions are stingy about alarm apps.

1) Allow notifications from the app (usually in "App info")
2) Unset "Pause app activity if unused"
3) Set "Allow notifications even when Do Not Disturb is on"
4) Add exception for the app in "Do Not Disturb" where it says "Apps in the exceptions list are allowed to interrupt Do Not Disturb"
5) Crucial: "Allow background activity" (usually in "Power consumption controls")
6) Even more important: find the app in "Optimize battery use" and set it to "Don't optimize".
   Usually in Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization
7) Some manufacturers add specific "Special" permissions like "Alarms & reminders", enable the app in the settings.

After all this the app should work (on most devices) even if it is swiped out.
If not, leave it in the background (i.e. don't swipe it out)
Sometimes the background service gets messed up; try "Force stop", or just reboot the phone.
If nothing works, try this as a last resort:   adb shell dumpsys deviceidle disable
This will disable doze mode (that is not particularly useful anyway)
